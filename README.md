For Test Some Funny Rule

## Installation (not Ready)

this is just a funny place for make some personal experimental rule, install is not going to work

## Before You Start To Write Some Rule
You should have some AST tree base knowledge, here is [my reference](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/code-path-analysis)

Or you can see some example from [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/tree/b9aa04b10d9bb0b7274ad314ca125ddefd9fbdb3/lib/rules)

## Use
1. First, you need to install the dependency
```sh
$ npm install or yarn
```
1. create new file and write your funny rule in ```lib/rules```

2. write your test file in ```tests/lib/rules```

3. run you test by command ```yarn run test```
